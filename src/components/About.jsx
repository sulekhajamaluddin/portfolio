          <p>
            I am Sulekha, an IT engineer by education following my passion to
            get back to the field after a little adventure in the world of
            administration. I am very much motivated by frontend development.
            This is my website that I use to showcase the work I do. <br />I
            like to explore and bring together minimalistic designs with a sense
            of responsibility and give them a signature touch. Scroll on, let me
            show you some of them.
